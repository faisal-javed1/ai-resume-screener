the company owned in its efforts to deploy a new offering, an enterprise software as a service (saas) product. i was initially an employee of an adsystech customer working with the adsystech evp on an enterprise county wide project and posed the idea that they should move from ""selling"" software to ""renting"" it via an up and coming model saas. today, everyone is using saas products and paying monthly for various products but in 2004 (when i initially made the proposal) it was an exciting and new potential market which i leveraged to increase the returns at adsystech and most importantly, generate new recurring revenue. i was hired in 05' to put in place all things saas, this included designing a data center from the ground up, creating cyber security policies and controls, putting together a team to support the data center as well as a team to provide technical support for the new product offering. as an early adopter, in 2008 i designed and deployed a hybrid cloud environment in our data center. again in 08' this was a new technology but my decision demonstrates foresight in emerging technologies and understand in the value of leveraging technology to become more efficient
